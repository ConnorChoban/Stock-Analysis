# VBA Challenge

Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis is to refactor preexisting code in order to be able to apply it to a wider set of variables. In doing so, we can save time and effort by applying the code for one array of tickers to other sets in information to gain new insights on stock performance.

Results

In 2017 we can see that all but one of the tickers realized gains, including DQ which was the base for our original analysis. We can see that DQ was the highest performing stock in the set, with a return of approximately 199%. Conversely, TERP lost value, posting a return of -7%. In 2018, however, we see that DQ posted a loss of around 63%. The average 2 year return, combining both values is around 69% or so. Thus we can infer that despite the loss realized in 2018, DQ has an excellent return on investment. However, there is one other stock that posted an even higher return on investment. ENPH recorded a gain of 130% in 2017 and a gain of 82% in 2018, for a total gain of 212% over the two year period. Thus, all factors remaining constant for future growth, we should recommend that Steve's parents focus their nvestments on ENPH.

For the original code we can see that the macro produced the results in the time below:

For the refactored code we can see that the code was somewhat faster. 



Summary

One of the biggest advantages of refactoring code is that we can reuse preexisting code to improve efficiency and save time. We can also ensure quality control to a certain degree by using code that we know works and deliver results. On the other hand, one of the disadvantages is that it can be easy to overlook issues in the source code so it's critical to ensure that we understand what's happening in the original code. 

In this challenge, having access to the original code helped immensely because it gave me the opportunity to build off of someone else's work and I could then focus all of my efforts on directing the code to produce the results I was looking for (ex. creating an chart that shows the values for all tickers and not just DQ). However, the disadvantage was that, without the notes already available in the code, it would have been difficult to know where to start.
